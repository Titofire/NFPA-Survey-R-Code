# NFPA-Survey-R-Code
This R file will generate tables for each line form Section three and four of the NFPA "Survey of Fire Departments for United States Fire Experience During 2021. The process used first was generating a .csv file from our Fire House Software and then creating a table from it. That table was then filtered and used by each code chunk to generate a specific table for each line in the survey in section three and four. If you have a *basic* knowledge of "r" like I do, this the code should speak for itself. Please email me with any questions. 
## Have a Great day!
