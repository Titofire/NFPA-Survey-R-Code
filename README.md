# NFPA-Survey-R-Code
This R file will generate tables for each line form Section three and four of the NFPA "Survey of Fire Deparment for United States Fire Experience During 2021. The pocess used first was generateing a .csv file from our database Fire House Soft ware and then creating a table from it. That table was then filtered and used by each code chunk to genereate a specific table for each line in the survey in section three and four. If you have a basic knowage of "r" like I do, this the code should speak for itself. Please email me with any questions. 
## Have a Great day!
